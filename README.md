# 📈 Linear Regression from Scratch  

This project implements **Linear Regression from scratch** using **Gradient Descent** without relying on machine learning libraries like scikit-learn.  

## 🚀 Features  
- Implementation of the **Mean Squared Error (MSE)** loss function  
- **Gradient Descent** optimization step by step  
- Visualization of:  
  - Best-fit line vs. data points   

## 📊 Results  
- The model learns the parameters (slope & intercept) directly from data  
- Gradient Descent converges smoothly as shown in the loss curve  

## 🛠️ Tech Stack  
- **Python**  
- **NumPy** (for math operations)  
- **Matplotlib** (for graphs)  

## 📷 Sample Outputs  
**Best Fit Line**: Data points with predicted regression line
